# 2026-01-29 Feature Decisions

## Scope Notes
- The chat interface is adapter-based; Slack is only an example, not an assumption.
- Web UI is out of scope for now.
- Streaming responses are out of scope for now.
- Authentication is not provided; users are distinguished only by message metadata.
- Sessions are scoped per chat thread; users can join a thread mid-conversation.

## Configuration and Deployment
- Configuration is TOML.
- The binary is intended to run as a service.

## Deprioritized Areas
- Error handling
- Security
- Compatibility
