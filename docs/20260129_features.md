# 2026-01-29 Feature Decisions

## Scope Notes
- The chat interface is adapter-based; Slack only is implemented for now.
- Web UI is out of scope for now.
- Streaming responses are out of scope for now.
- Authentication is not provided; users are distinguished only by message metadata.

## Session Model
- Main timeline uses a shared session.
- A thread reply spawns a new session seeded from a snapshot at thread start.
- Replies within a thread reuse the thread session; users can join mid-thread.

## Slack Integration
- Input: Slack Socket Mode (Events API app_mention).
- Output: post when Stop/SubagentStop/Notification hooks fire.

## Runtime and Configuration
- tmux/Claude Code command is fixed; working directory is fixed.
- Configuration is TOML; Slack bot token and app token are required.
- Deployment is a standalone binary (direct execution).

## Architecture Notes
- Core domains are Conversation, Terminal Session, and Claude Context.
- Error notifications are handled by the coordinator and sent through Conversation output (no standalone notifier module).

## Implementation Notes
- Language: Rust.
- Interface sketch added to `docs/design.md` as a draft.
- Conversation adapter is a single interface with both subscribe and send.

## Deprioritized Areas
- Security
- Compatibility
