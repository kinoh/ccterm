# 2026-01-30 README Permissions

## Decisions
- Added a README that documents the minimum Slack scopes for Socket Mode and app_mention replies.
- Documented optional `chat:write.public` for posting to public channels without joining.
- Clarified that hooks should use `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` so per-thread directories resolve correctly.
